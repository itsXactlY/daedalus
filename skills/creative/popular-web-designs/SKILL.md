# Popular Web Designs

54 real-world design systems ready for use when generating HTML/CSS. Each template captures a
site's complete visual language: color palette, typography hierarchy, component styles, spacing
system, shadows, responsive behavior, and practical agent prompts with exact CSS values.

## Related design skills

- **`claude-design`** — use for the design *process and taste* (scoping a brief,
  producing variants, verifying a local HTML artifact, avoiding AI-design slop).
  Pair it with this skill when the user wants a thoughtfully-designed page styled
  after a known brand: `claude-design` drives the workflow, this skill supplies
  the visual vocabulary.
- **`design-md`** — use when the deliverable is a formal DESIGN.md token spec
  file, not a rendered artifact.

## How to Use

1. Pick a design from the catalog below
2. Load it: `skill_view(name="popular-web-designs", file_path="templates/<site>.md")`
3. Use the design tokens and component specs when generating HTML
4. Pair with the `generative-widgets` skill to serve the result via cloudflared tunnel

Each template includes a **Daedalus Implementation Notes** block at the top with:
- CDN font substitute and Google Fonts `<link>` tag (ready to paste)
- CSS font-family stacks for primary and monospace
- Reminders to use `write_file` for HTML creation and `browser_vision` for verification

## Cherry-Picking Discipline (polishing an EXISTING design)

When the task is "make my existing page look more like X/Y/Z" (not "build from
scratch"), do NOT wholesale-copy a template. Apply only the best-of-best
patterns that survive contact with the site's locked design tokens:

1. **Audit the existing token lock first** — read the site's :root variables,
   weight limits, accent palette, and typography voice. Anything that fights
   them gets rejected.
2. **Take one signature pattern per system** — Linear's weight system (their
   real rule: workhorse 510, announce max 590 — NOT 600 everywhere), Vercel's
   inset inner-glow ring, Stripe's brand-tinted chromatic shadows, Sentry's
   tactile inset buttons + frosted glass blur(12px) saturate(160%).
3. **Document explicit rejections** — e.g. Stripe's weight-300 whisper
   headlines conflict with a Linear-510 voice; Vercel's white gallery
   conflicts with dark-native; Sentry's lime conflicts with a locked warm
   accent (ember); Linear's #5e6ad2 indigo CTA conflicts with a locked violet
   at a measured contrast ratio. State WHY each was rejected.
4. **Verify with computed styles, not eyes** — see Verification below.

## Verification (headless, no puppeteer)

The two reliable techniques, both with only Node + google-chrome-stable:

**Computed-style probe** — `--dump-dom` cannot run JS, so build a same-origin
probe: a second http server on another port that serves the site files and a
`/probe` page which iframes the site (same origin!) and dumps
`getComputedStyle` results into `document.title`/body after onload+timeout.
Read via `--dump-dom`. Cross-origin iframes block computed styles; same-origin
works. Verify the exact claims: `fontWeight`, `letterSpacing`, `backdropFilter`,
`boxShadow` (check `includes('inset')`, brand color `rgba(139, 92, 246)`), and
`fontVariantNumeric`.

**Pixel-diff region analysis** — screenshot before and after with PIL; diff
three regions (hero / changed component / rest-of-page). Expect: changed
regions differ, rest-of-page ~0. If the rest-of-page ALSO differs, either the
change cascades (e.g. heading weight rule applies to all h2/h3 — expected) or
layout broke. Count bright pixels per band to confirm text still renders.

Also run: brace-balance check (`{` count == `}` count) and a weight audit
(`grep 'font-weight:' | sort | uniq -c` — only intended weights present).

## Pitfalls

- **Headless Chrome screenshot timing vs scroll-reveal**: sites with
  `.fx .fade` / IntersectionObserver reveals show ALL text below the hero as
  invisible (opacity:0) when `--virtual-time-budget=4000` is too short for the
  reveal to fire. Bright-pixel counts drop 10-40x and it looks like the page
  broke. This is a FALSE ALARM — re-shoot with `--virtual-time-budget=8000+`
  before suspecting a CSS regression. Diagnose with PIL luma bands per 1/8
  slice + bright-pixel (>180) counts.
- Weight audit traps: grep output mixes full rule lines — expect lines like
  `500; letter-spacing...` as false positives; the audit is about spotting
  unexpected standalone weights (600 where the design says ≤590, etc.).
- Don't trust a single screenshot: virtual-time races are common. Take two
  budgets (4s and 8s) before concluding "text disappeared".

## HTML Generation Pattern

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Page Title</title>
  <!-- Paste the Google Fonts <link> from the template's Daedalus notes -->
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=..." rel="stylesheet">
  <style>
    /* Apply the template's color palette as CSS custom properties */
    :root {
      --color-bg: #ffffff;
      --color-text: #171717;
      --color-accent: #533afd;
      /* ... more from template Section 2 */
    }
    /* Apply typography from template Section 3 */
    body {
      font-family: 'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif;
      color: var(--color-text);
      background: var(--color-bg);
    }
    /* Apply component styles from template Section 4 */
    /* Apply layout from template Section 5 */
    /* Apply shadows from template Section 6 */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Build using component specs from the template -->
</body>
</html>
```

Write the file with `write_file`, serve with the `generative-widgets` workflow (cloudflared tunnel),
and verify the result with `browser_vision` to confirm visual accuracy.

## Font Substitution Reference

Most sites use proprietary fonts unavailable via CDN. Each template maps to a Google Fonts
substitute that preserves the design's character. Common mappings:

| Proprietary Font | CDN Substitute | Character |
|---|---|---|
| Geist / Geist Sans | Geist (on Google Fonts) | Geometric, compressed tracking |
| Geist Mono | Geist Mono (on Google Fonts) | Clean monospace, ligatures |
| sohne-var (Stripe) | Source Sans 3 | Light weight elegance |
| Berkeley Mono | JetBrains Mono | Technical monospace |
| Airbnb Cereal VF | DM Sans | Rounded, friendly geometric |
| Circular (Spotify) | DM Sans | Geometric, warm |
| figmaSans | Inter | Clean humanist |
| Pin Sans (Pinterest) | DM Sans | Friendly, rounded |
| NVIDIA-EMEA | Inter (or Arial system) | Industrial, clean |
| CoinbaseDisplay/Sans | DM Sans | Geometric, trustworthy |
| UberMove | DM Sans | Bold, tight |
| HashiCorp Sans | Inter | Enterprise, neutral |
| waldenburgNormal (Sanity) | Space Grotesk | Geometric, slightly condensed |
| IBM Plex Sans/Mono | IBM Plex Sans/Mono | Available on Google Fonts |
| Rubik (Sentry) | Rubik | Available on Google Fonts |

When a template's CDN font matches the original (Inter, IBM Plex, Rubik, Geist), no
substitution loss occurs. When a substitute is used (DM Sans for Circular, Source Sans 3
for sohne-var), follow the template's weight, size, and letter-spacing values closely —
those carry more visual identity than the specific font face.
