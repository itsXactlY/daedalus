# Adaptive Agent Execution

A meta-skill for operating as an autonomous agent when:
- Platform limits restrict tool access (e.g., no history read in Discord)
- State is unknown or drift exists between config and reality
- Tools may fail due to bot detection, auth, or timeouts
- You must rely on user-provided context to build understanding

## When to Use
- You're in a messaging platform (Discord, Telegram, etc.) and need to accomplish a goal
- User has shared context: docs, config files, channel references, setup guides
- You suspect config/state drift (e.g., empty channels, wrong IDs)
- You plan to use tools that might be blocked (browser, web search, external APIs)
- You need to close the loop by reporting outcomes to the correct place

## Core Loop: Sense → Think → Act → Adapt → Report

### 1. **SENSE: Ingest User Context** (Build situational awareness)
> **Do NOT assume** — read what the user gave you.

**Actions:**
- `read_file()` on user-provided docs:  
  - `~/discord-backup.md` → channel semantics, purposes, IDs  
  - `~/discord-setup-quickref.md` → quick channel map, free-response list  
  - `~/discord-setup.md` → full architecture  
- `search_files()` for patterns: `free_response`, `home_channel`, `reporting`  
- Build mental model:  
  - Where am I? (current channel)  
  - Where can I act freely? (free-response channels)  
  - Where should I report? (dev-control-room for dev, trading-command for ops, etc.)  
  - What is each channel for? (semantics)

**Output:** Internal map of `<channel_id> → {purpose, semantics, response_rules}`

### 2. **THINK: Validate Alignment** (Detect and fix drift)
> **Check if current state matches documented intent.**

**Actions:**
- Read Daedalus config: `read_file(path="~/.daedalus/config.yaml")`  
- Check key fields:  
  - `discord.free_response_channels` → should match user’s free-response list  
  - `discord.home_channel` → should match ops-control-room (or user’s home)  
  - `discord.routing.dev_control_room` → verify ID matches `dev-control-room` from backup  
- If drift found:  
  - Use `patch()` or `write_file()` to correct config  
  - Save correction to `memory` (target='user') with note: “Corrected X based on user docs”  
  - Example: “Populated empty free_response_channels from discord-setup-quickref.md”

**Output:** Aligned config + memory entry documenting the fix

### 3. **ACT: Execute with Available Tools** (Use what works)
> **Tool-first**: gather raw data before concluding.  
> **Infra-first**: reuse proven systems (BTQuant, trading terminal) over rebuilding.  
> **Doc-first**: use QUICKSTART, STATUS files for handoffs.

**Preferred Tools (in order):**
1. `execute_code` (Python) → for multi-step logic, filtering, loops  
2. `terminal` → for sysadmin, git, builds  
3. `file_tools` (read_file, write_file, patch, search_files) → for config/logs  
4. `delegate_task` → for reasoning-heavy subtasks (debugging, research)  
5. `browser` → only when needed; expect CAPTCHAs/timeouts  
6. `web_search` / `web_extract` → only if API keys available  

**Avoid:**  
- Assuming tool availability  
- Performing mechanical multi-step work without reasoning → use `execute_code`  
- Interactive user input in subagents → they can’t use `clarify`

### 4. **ADAPT: Pivot When Blocked** (Expect failure)
> **Tools will fail**. Detect and shift strategy.

**Common Blocks & Responses:**
| Block | Detection | Adaptation |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Browser CAPTCHA / bot check | `browser_navigate` succeeds but snapshot shows challenge | Pivot to: `session_search`, `skills_list`, user clarification, or text-only research |
| Timeout / unresponsive | `browser_*` or `terminal` exceeds expected time | Fallback: use cached data, ask user for clarification, reduce scope |
| Missing API key | Tool returns `check_fn=false` or auth error | Use open alternatives: DuckDuckGo (no key), arXiv (no key), local docs |
| No history access (Discord) | Can’t read past messages | Rely on: user-provided context, `memory`, `session_search` (if enabled), skills |
| Tool not enabled | `check_fn=false` in tool list | Enable via `/tools` or inform user of limitation |

**General Adaptation Pattern:**
1. Try primary tool (e.g., `browser_navigate` → `browser_snapshot`)  
2. If blocked/timeout/unclear:  
   - Capture what you *did* get (screenshot, partial text)  
   - Try lighter alternative: `browser_console`, `browser_vision` (if model available)  
   - If still blocked: shift to internal tools (`execute_code`, `file_tools`)  
   - If all else fails: `clarify(user)` with specific question  

**Example from this session:**  
- Tried: DuckDuckGo search via browser → hit CAPTCHA  
- Adapted: Used `skills_list` + `execute_code` to analyze our skill set internally  
- Outcome: Produced summary of capabilities despite external block

### 5. **REPORT: Close the Loop** (Deliver to correct place)
> **Never leave output dangling**. Always route to semantic channel.

**Actions:**
- Determine report type:  
  - System health / metrics → `feed-system-health` or `dev-control-room`  
  - Code status / dev update → `dev-control-room`  
  - Trading signal / market data → `trading-command` or `trading-war-room`  
  - Incident / alert → `ops-control-room` or `ops-incidents`  
  - Research findings → `research-output` or `research-watchers`  
- Format output appropriately:  
  - Markdown for dev/ops (code blocks, tables)  
  - Concise alert for incidents  
  - Structured data (JSON) for machine feeds  
- Use `send_message(target="discord:#channel-name", message=<formatted>)`  
- **OR** rely on free-response: if in allowed channel, just send  

**Verification:**  
- After sending, check `process` or `session_search` (if available) to confirm delivery  
- If uncertain, ask: “Did this reach the right place?” via `clarify`

### 6. **UPDATE: Save What You Learned** (Close the meta-loop)
> **Every execution should improve the agent.**

**Actions:**
- If you corrected config → save to `memory` (target='user')  
- If you discovered a workaround → save as `skill` via `skill_manage(action='create')`  
- If you found a better way to do something → `skill_manage(action='patch')` on existing skill  
- If user corrected you → immediate `memory` update (don’t wait to be asked)  

**Memory Priority:**  
1. User preferences/corrections (highest value — prevents future repetition)  
2. Environment facts (OS, tools, quirks)  
3. Proceditional knowledge (workflows, pitfalls)  

**Never save to memory:**  
- Task progress, TODOs, session outcomes, temporary state  
→ Use `session_search` to recall those from past transcripts  

## Verification Checklist
After execution, confirm:
- [ ] User context was read and synthesized (not assumed)  
- [ ] Config drift was detected and corrected (if present)  
- [ ] Primary action used available tools effectively  
- [ ] Blockage was anticipated and adaptation occurred  
- [ ] Output was routed to semantically correct channel  
- [ ] At least one thing was saved to memory or skill (if useful)  

## Example: System Health Report to dev-control-room
**Context:** User in `admin-control`, wants system status reported  
1. **SENSE**: Read `discord-setup-quickref.md` → learn `dev-control-room` is for reports  
2. **THINT**: Read config → see `free_response_channels` empty → populate it  
3. **ACT**: Use `execute_code` to gather disk, memory, CPU, services, Ollama → format markdown  
4. **ADAPT**: Tried browser for web research → hit CAPTCHA → pivoted to internal `skills_list` analysis  
5. **REPORT**: Sent report to `discord:#dev-control-room` via `send_message`  
6. **UPDATE**: Saved config fix to memory: “Populated free_response_channels from quickref”
