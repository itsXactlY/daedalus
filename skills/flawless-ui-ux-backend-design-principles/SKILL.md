# Flawless UI/UX & Backend Design Principles

## Core Philosophy

**Design for humans first, systems second.** A flawless interface anticipates user needs, eliminates cognitive load, and provides instant feedback while maintaining rock-solid backend stability under any load.

---

## UI/UX Design Principles

### 1. Performance-First Interface

**Rule:** Every interaction must feel instantaneous (<100ms perceived latency).

- **Critical rendering path optimization:** Prioritize above-the-fold content
- **Skeleton screens:** Show loading state immediately, not blank screens
- **Progressive disclosure:** Show only what's needed now; reveal complexity gradually
- **Micro-interactions:** Subtle feedback for every action (button press, form validation, state change)
- **Animation timing:** 50-100ms for immediate feedback; 200-300ms for state transitions
- **Never block the UI thread:** Offload heavy computations to web workers/service workers

### 2. Accessibility as Foundation

**Rule:** If it's not accessible, it's not done.

- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum:** Text contrast 4.5:1, touch targets ≥44×44px, keyboard navigation
- **Semantic HTML:** Use proper elements (button, nav, main, section, article) for screen readers
- **ARIA labels:** Only when semantic HTML insufficient; prefer native elements
- **Focus management:** Logical tab order, visible focus indicators, trap focus in modals
- **Error states:** Inline validation with clear, actionable error messages
- **Responsive design:** Fluid layouts that work from 320px to 4K+ displays
- **Reduced motion preference:** Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query

### 3. Consistency & Predictability

**Rule:** Users should never guess what an element does.

- **Design system adherence:** Strict use of design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- **Component library:** Reusable, well-documented components with clear APIs
- **Interaction patterns:** Standardized behaviors (swipe gestures, hover states, loading indicators)
- **Naming consistency:** Verb-noun button labels, consistent placeholder text
- **Error handling:** Uniform error presentation across all interfaces

### 4. Cognitive Load Reduction

**Rule:** Minimize mental effort required to achieve goals.

- **Progressive disclosure:** Show advanced options only when needed
- **Smart defaults:** Pre-fill form fields with intelligent predictions
- **Contextual help:** Tooltips and inline guidance appear at moment of need
- **Visual hierarchy:** Clear focal points guide eye movement naturally
- **Information scent:** Labels and icons clearly communicate function
- **Workflow optimization:** Reduce steps, eliminate redundant data entry
- **Complex-system harmony maps:** For dense technical systems, expose a stack-level operating map plus domain drilldowns instead of a generic dashboard. Users need one glance at system harmony and a traceable path into every component. See `references/complex-system-harmony.md` for the core pattern and pitfalls, and `references/btquant-harmony-weather-organism.md` for a concrete weather-organism implementation pattern. For BTQuant specifically, do not let the metaphor hide required domain truth: CCAPI, HotSpine, C++ detectors, Backtrader/Cerebro, brokers, stores, feeds, agency, neural, MCP, PULSE, and limitations must remain first-class surfaces.

### 5. Error Prevention & Recovery

**Rule:** Assume users will make mistakes; design accordingly.

- **Undo/redo:** Universal undo for destructive actions
- **Confirmation dialogs:** Only for irreversible, high-impact actions
- **Input validation:** Real-time, inline validation with specific guidance
- **Empty states:** Educational empty states that teach how to get started
- **Error recovery:** Clear paths forward from error states, not dead ends
- **Graceful degradation:** Core functionality works even when features fail

---

## Backend Design Principles

### 1. Reliability & Fault Tolerance

**Rule:** Systems must remain operational despite failures.

- **Idempotency:** All operations safe to retry (POST/PUT/DELETE)
- **Circuit breaker pattern:** Prevent cascade failures when dependencies fail
- **Retry with exponential backoff:** Handle transient network issues gracefully
- **Health checks:** Liveness and readiness probes for all services
- **Graceful shutdown:** Complete in-flight requests before terminating
- **Data validation:** Validate all inputs at API boundary (never trust client)
- **Timeouts:** Set reasonable timeouts for all external calls

### 2. Scalability & Performance

**Rule:** Scale horizontally, not vertically; optimize for throughput.

- **Stateless services:** No session storage in application instances
- **Database connection pooling:** Efficient reuse of database connections
- **Caching strategy:** Multi-layer caching (CDN, Redis, in-memory) with proper TTL
- **Database indexing:** Index queried columns; avoid over-indexing
- **Async processing:** Offload long-running tasks to message queues
- **Pagination & limits:** Never return unbounded result sets
- **Database connection limits:** Prevent connection exhaustion under load

### 3. Security by Design

**Rule:** Security is not a feature; it's the foundation.

- **Principle of least privilege:** Services run with minimal required permissions
- **Input validation & sanitization:** Prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command)
- **Authentication & authorization:** JWT/OAuth2 with proper token validation
- **Rate limiting:** Protect against abuse and brute force attacks
- **Secrets management:** Never hardcode credentials; use vaults or environment
- **HTTPS everywhere:** TLS 1.3, HSTS, proper certificate management
- **Dependency scanning:** Regular vulnerability scans of all dependencies

### 4. Observability & Debuggability

**Rule:** You cannot fix what you cannot see.

- **Structured logging:** JSON logs with correlation IDs for request tracing
- **Distributed tracing:** OpenTelemetry or similar for cross-service tracing
- **Metrics collection:** Key metrics (latency, error rates, throughput) via Prometheus
- **Alerting:** Actionable alerts based on SLOs, not just thresholds
- **Health endpoints:** `/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics` endpoints
- **Error tracking:** Centralized error collection with stack traces
- **Audit logs:** Immutable logs for security-critical operations

### 5. Maintainability & Evolvability

**Rule:** Code should be easy to understand, modify, and extend.

- **Single responsibility principle:** Each function/class does one thing well
- **Clear abstractions:** Hide implementation details behind clean interfaces
- **Consistent naming:** Predictable, descriptive names for functions/variables
- **Documentation:** Public APIs documented; complex algorithms explained
- **Testing strategy:** Unit (>80%), integration, and contract tests
- **Dependency inversion:** Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **Feature flags:** Safe deployment of new features via toggles
- **Database migrations:** Versioned, reversible migrations

---

## UI/UX-Backend Integration Principles

### 1. Contract-First Development

**Rule:** Define APIs before implementing either side.

- **OpenAPI/Specification:** Version-controlled API contracts
- **Mock servers:** Frontend can develop against mocked API early
- **Contract testing:** Verify implementations match specifications
- **Versioning strategy:** Semantic versioning or date-based versioning
- **Backward compatibility:** Maintain compatibility for reasonable period

### 2. Data Flow & State Management

**Rule:** Single source of truth; avoid state synchronization issues.

- **State synchronization:** Optimistic UI updates with backend reconciliation
- **Loading states:** Clear indication when data is being fetched/saved
- **Error boundaries:** Isolate failures to prevent cascade UI issues
- **Cache invalidation:** Clear strategy for when cached data becomes stale
- **Real-time updates:** WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for live data
- **Offline capability:** Queue local changes for sync when back online

### 3. Performance Budget & Monitoring

**Rule:** Measure what matters to users.

- **Core Web Vitals:** LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- **User timing marks:** Custom metrics for key user journeys
- **Backend latency:** API response times (p50, p95, p99)
- **Error rates:** Track both frontend and backend errors
- **Conversion metrics:** Tie performance to business outcomes
- **Continuous monitoring:** Real-user monitoring (RUM) in production
